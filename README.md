### This is the data for my blog from [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io), and thanks [Tom Preston-Werner](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io) codes and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll)

# This is the data for my blog

It is automatically transformed by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some remote
server. That is backwards. I've lost valuable posts that way. I want to author
my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should be easily stylable and
customizable any way I please. It should take care of creating a feed for me.
And most of all, my site should be stored on GitHub so that I never lose data
again.
